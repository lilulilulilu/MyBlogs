## GPU - graphic processing unit
A GPU is a processor that use parallel processing to speed up their operations. 

## CPU - central processing unit
A CPU is a processor that is considered as the brain of the computer.
CPUs perform basic logic, arithmetic, and I/O operations, and allocate commands to other components and subsystems running in a computer.

## CUDA - Compute Unified Device Architecture
CUDA provides an API that lets developers leverage GPU resources without requiring specialized knowledge about GPU hardware

## the difference between GPU and CPU [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clCPQo0-quo)
GPU cores are less powerful than CPU cores.

While CPUs can switch between different instruction sets rapidly, a GPU simply takes a high volume of the same instructions and pushes them through at high speed. 

As a result, GPU play an important role in parallel computing.

GPUs use parallel processing to speed up their operations. 

They divide tasks into smaller parts, and distribute them among multiple processor cores (up to hundreds of cores) running within the same GPU.

GPU provide better performance for specialized parallel computing tasks than CPU.
